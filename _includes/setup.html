<h3>Overview</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      When you're writing scripts or text, it's nice to have a text
      editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
      like automatic color-coding of key words.
      The default text editor on Mac OS X and Linux is usually set to Vim,
      which is not famous for being intuitive.
      if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it,
      try typing the escape key,
      followed by ':wq!' (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark),
      then hitting Return
      to return to the shell. (This will exit Vim <b> and</b> save the changes you made in the file.)
    </p>
    <h4>The Bash Shell</h4>
    <p>
      Bash is a commonly-used shell. Using a shell gives you
      more power to do more tasks more quickly with your
      computer.
    </p>
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      Python is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for
      general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its scientific
      packages individually can be a bit difficult, so we recommend an
      all-in-one installer (e.g. <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>).

      Regardless of how you choose to install it, <strong>please make sure you install
      Python version 2.x and not version 3.x</strong> (e.g., 2.7 is fine but not 3.4).
      Python 3 introduced changes that will break some of the code we teach
      during the workshop.

    <h4>SQL</h4>
    <p>
      SQL is a specialized programming language used with databases.
      We use a simple database manager called <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>,
      either directly or through a browser plugin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Spreadsheet</h4>
      We'll be using a spreadsheet program. If you already have a spreadsheet program
installed, like LibreOffice, Excel or OpenOffice, you can use whatever you already have.
If you don't have a spreadsheet program, please
<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/">download</a>
and install LibreOffice.

<h3>Everyone needs to install these (regardless of your platform)</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4 id="firefox-sqlite">Firefox SQLite Plugin</h4>
    <p>
      Instead of using <code>sqlite3</code> from the command line,
      you will use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">this plugin</a>
      for Firefox instead. If you don't already have firefox, <a href="https://getfirefox.com">install</a> it first.
      To install the sqlite plugin:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Start Firefox.
      </li>
      <li>
	Go to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">plugin homepage</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	Click the "Add Now" button.
      </li>
      <li>
	Click "Install Now" on the dialog that appears after the download completes.
      </li>
      <li>
	Restart Firefox when prompted.
      </li>
      <li>
	To check that it was installed correctly, select "SQLite Manager" from
	the "Tools" menu. If the menu is hidden, use the "Alt" key near the
	spacebar to make it appear.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="span6">
    <h4 id="openrefine">Open Refine</h4>
    <p>
      We will use Open Refine to clean up data. Go to
      their <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download page</a>
      and install the stable version for your operating system.
    </p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">

  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a
      popular free code editor for Windows.
      Be aware that you must add its installation directory to your system path
      in order to launch it from the command line
      (or have other tools like Git launch it for you). The instructions to modify your path are available <a href="http://goo.gl/ANGRGR">online here</a>. Please ask your instructor to help you do this.
    </p>
    <h4>Git Bash</h4>
    <p>
      Install Git (version control) and a Bash shell for Windows from
      <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">the msysGit project's homepage</a>.
      This will provide you with Bash in the Git Bash program.
    </p>
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      Download and install <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a>.
      Download the default Python 2 installer (do not follow the link to
      version 3). Use all of the defaults for installation <em>except</em> make sure
      to check <strong>Make Anaconda the default Python</strong>.
    </p>
   </div>


  <div class="span6">
    <h4>SQLite</h4>
    <p>
      Install the Firefox SQLite browser plugin described <a href="#firefox-sqlite">above</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Software Carpentry Installer</h4>
      <p>Other tools used in Data Carpentry have been packaged up by
  Software Carpentry in an installer. This installer requires an active internet connection.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Download the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/177341/SWCarpentryInstaller.exe">installer</a>.
        </li>
      <li>
        Double click on the file to run it.
      </li>
      <li>
        A command window will open and then close again. The installer downloads and installs a couple of command line programs that we'll need for course.
      </li>
      <li>If you saw it open and then close again, you're set!
    </ul>

      (Installation requires using the shell and if you aren't comfortable doing
      the installation yourself just download the installer and we'll help you at
      the boot camp.)
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download the installer that matches your operating system and save
          it in your home folder. Download the default Python 2 installer (do not
          follow the link to version 3).

        <li>Open a terminal window.</li>
        <li>
          Type:
          <pre>bash Anaconda-</pre>
          and then press tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.
        </li>
        <li>
          Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts. When there is a colon
          at the bottom of the screen press the down arrow to move down through the

          approve the default location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and press enter to
          prepend Anaconda to your <code>PATH</code> (this makes the Anaconda distribution the
          default Python).
